# Nx Angular Monorepo Architecture Sample

This repo is an example of a monorepo architecture using Nx and Angular. It contains a simple todo application with a shared library and a backend API.

## Commands

See the package.json to run the following comands:

- `npm run s.todo.dev` to start the development server for the todo app
- `npm run b.todo.dev` to build the todo app for development
- `npm run s.todo.api` to start the development server for the api
- `npm run storybook` to start the storybook server
- `npm run build-storybook` to build the storybook app

## Directory Structure

The monorepo is structured as follows ( not including e2e apps ):

```
apps/
  storybook-app/                       # Storybook app
  task-manager/                        # Domain ( Domain Driven Design ) for TODO app
    api/                               # Backend API for the TODO app    
    capacitorjs/                       # CapacitorJS - android, ios - for todo app
    todo/                              # Angular app for the TODO app

libs/
  shared/                              # Shared libraries for ALL apps and domain libraries
    domain/                            # Shared business logic for all apps and libraries
    tailwind-preset/                   # Shared tailwindcss preset
    ui-design-library-components/      # Shared UI components for all apps and ui libraries
  task-manager/                        # Domain ( Domain Driven Design ) for TODO app
    domain/                            # Business logic for the task-manager domain               
    ui-task-manager/                   # UI components for the task-manager domain _only_
